Apartment Hunt AI is an intelligent rental search tool powered by GPT. It allows users to describe their ideal apartment in natural language and returns personalized listings based on lifestyle preferences such as safety, noise levels, commute time, and nearby points of interest.  

This project showcases a strong engineering skillset: **AI integration, web scraping, API integration, full-stack development, prompt engineering, and user-centered product design**—skills highly valued by hiring teams.
